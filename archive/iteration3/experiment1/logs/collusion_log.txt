FPA Collusion Results:
Agent 0: Retaliation = 0.25, Accommodation = 0.00, Index = 0.12
Agent 1: Retaliation = 0.25, Accommodation = 0.00, Index = 0.12
Overall Collusion Index: 0.12
Interpretation: No evidence of collusion, agents act independently

SPA Collusion Results:
Agent 0: Retaliation = 0.50, Accommodation = 0.00, Index = 0.25
Agent 1: Retaliation = 0.25, Accommodation = 0.00, Index = 0.12
Overall Collusion Index: 0.19
Interpretation: No evidence of collusion, agents act independently
